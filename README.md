## *Dedicated to creatively analyse, design and invent technology solutions that solve real problems.* 

I care passionately about providing tangible results,
without sacrificing artistry and 
elegant design.

- I also really love the "abstract and logical universe of Computer Science".

My persistent drive towards growth and knowledge motivates me to
learn new technologies,
adapt and 
grow,
with a tremendous pace!
- I really value progress.

I am focused on leaving a legacy and living well examined life.
